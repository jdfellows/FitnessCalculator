# FitnessCalculator
This was an assignment for .NET Application Development Fall 2015

The purpose of this application is to allow the user to enter statistics related to their physical condition, calculate information useful to the user in planning out fitness goals, and display that information to the user.

The calculations used were:
Men
10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) + 5

Women
10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) - 161.
